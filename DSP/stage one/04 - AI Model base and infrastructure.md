#### **Files worked on:

`base_model.py` : Abstract base class defining the interface for all models with methods for pre-processing, inference, and postprocessing. 

`torch_model.py` : `PyTorch-specific` implementation of `base_model.py` providing common functionality for loading and running `PyTorch` models. 

`model_registry.py` : Maintains a registry of available models types, allowing dynamic loading and instantiation by name.

`inference_pipeline.py` : Manages the execution of multiple models in sequence, allowing for chaining different enhancements together.

----------------------
## <span style="color:rgb(255, 26, 26)">Errors during testing:</span> 

1. `CUDA` Device mismatch: Fixed a subtle PyTorch device inconsistency where the tensor was going to 'cuda:0' but the model device was just `CUDA`. Updated the model initialization to explicitly use the indexed device format `(cuda:0)` to ensure perfect matching.

2. `Pytest` collection warnings: Addressed confusion with helper classes named "Test..." being incorrectly flagged as test containers. Renamed these to "Mock..." to make `Pytest's` collection process cleaner without affecting test coverage.

3. Tensor shape and processing logic: Ensured proper dimension handling in the pre-processing pipeline. Fixed issues with channel ordering `(HWC vs CHW)` and batch dimension addition for consistent tensor processing.

4. Model initialization and path handling: Dealt with path validation issues and model loading. Made the test harness more robust by handling missing model files with appropriate fallbacks and error handling.

5. `PyTorch` security warning: Updated `torch.load()` calls to include `weights_only=True` to follow best security practices and eliminate warnings about potential code execution risks when loading model files.
