- **Missing Region Generation**  
    If part of a medical scan is corrupted or missing (due to noise or equipment errors), AI can predict and fill in what that area should look like. It helps doctors get a more complete view.
    
- **Synthetic Data Generation**  
    This means using AI to create completely new, realistic-looking medical images. These fake but believable images can be used to train or test other AI models when real data is limited.
    
- **Cross-Modality Translation**  
    AI converts one type of scan into another — for example, turning a CT scan into an MRI. This is useful when one scan type is missing or not available.
    
- **Super-Resolution via GANs**  
    Takes a low-quality or blurry image and turns it into a higher-resolution version. It helps doctors see fine details they might have missed.
    
- **Motion Artifact Correction**  
    Sometimes patients move during a scan, which causes blurring. AI can detect and remove these motion effects to clean up the image.
    
- **Noise-to-Image Translation**  
    When a scan is taken in low quality (e.g., low radiation to reduce harm), it’s often very noisy. AI can clean this up and reconstruct a clearer image from the noisy one.
    
- **AI-Powered Pre-Screening/Auto-Annotation**  
    AI takes a first look at a scan and highlights areas that may be abnormal (like tumours). This gives doctors a head start and saves time.
